apparmorxchat
=============
An AppArmor profile for XChat.
Works on any Linux with AppArmor installed i.e. openSUSE or Ubuntu.
XChat is an IRC client that hasn't been updated in a few years, and discovered vulnerabilities have not yet been patched. AppArmor enforces Mandatory Access Control for programs with a profile. This ensures that programs use only what resources are specified as allowed, reducing attack surface.
